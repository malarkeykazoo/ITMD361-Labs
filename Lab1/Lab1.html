  <p>Hello world. This is my first from-scratch website in almost 20 years</p>
  <p>I don't really know what to write about myself. Most of my "web design" experience anymore has been limited to WordPress.</p>
  <p>I am not a big fan of WordPress. I know it makes it simple, but I feel like you give up too much control.</p>
